        ⚠️ If you're reporting an interoperability issue with a **closed source**
        ActivityPub/Mastodon client or server, please report the issue to the
        developers of that client or server instead. Without access to their
        source debugging the issue is difficult for us. Since GoToSocial is
        open source, developers of closed source implementations can run a copy
        and autonomously debug the issue. We'll gladly address any bugs they
        raise with us.
